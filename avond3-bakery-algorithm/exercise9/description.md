Define r-bouded waiting for a given mutual exclution algorithm to mean that if ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?D_A^j%20\rightarrow%20D_B^k) then ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?CS_A^j%20\rightarrow%20CS_B^k^+^r). Is there a way to define a doorway for the Peterson algorithm such that it provides r-bounded waitng for some value of r?
